This is a wrapper around `eval-after-load' that:
1. Suppresses warnings for disabled packages at compile-time
2. No-ops for package that are disabled by the user (via `package!')
3. Supports compound package statements (see below)
4. Prevents eager expansion pulling in autoloaded macros all at once"
